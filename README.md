**Game Description**

==> Two players alternate turns using X and O on a 3x3 grid.

    consecutive "X" or "O" symbols in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal formation wins 
    the game.
    
==> A draw occurs in the game when all positions are filled and there are no three 
    identical symbols in a row.
